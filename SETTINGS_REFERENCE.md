# Cue — Settings Reference

Every pane, card, switch, dropdown and button in Settings, what it does, and
whether it is actually wired to anything.

- **Commit:** `85deb0e` (branch `fix/audit-sessions-1-3`, identical to `main`)
- **Generated:** 2026-09-14

## What "Works?" means here

This column is **static analysis, not device testing**. For every setting I
traced the stored property to the code that reads it:

- **Wired** — the value is read by code that acts on it. Traced to a specific
  consumer file. It is *connected*; I have not clicked each one on an Apple TV.
- **DEAD** — the control writes a value that **nothing ever reads**. Toggling it
  changes nothing at all.
- **Partial** — works, with a caveat spelled out in the notes.

A first pass flagged more settings as dead than really are. Several are consumed
through *computed aggregates* rather than by name — `streamMinResolution` and its
four siblings feed `PlayerSettings.streamFilterOptions`, and the five
Performance motion switches are read as `focusZoomEffective`,
`cardParallaxEffective` and so on. Those all work. Every "DEAD" below was
re-checked by hand for that pattern.

## Summary of what is broken

| Item | Where | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Hide torrent stats** | Integrations → P2P | **DEAD** — persisted, never read by anything |
| `pauseOverlayEnabled` | *(no UI)* | Dead model field — declared and decoded, never read |
| `osdClockEnabled` | *(no UI)* | Dead model field — declared and decoded, never read |
| `fullscreenHero` | *(no UI)* | Persisted **and synced to the account**, but no view reads it |
| `audioRendererEnabled` | *(no UI)* | Legacy — survives only as a migration fallback for **Surround & Dolby Atmos**. Correct as-is. |

Everything else in Settings is wired to a consumer.

Three settings are directly implicated in bugs currently under investigation —
see [Known interactions](#known-interactions-with-open-bugs) at the end.

## Settings rail

Ten categories, in rail order. **Plugins** is hidden unless
Appearance → Experience Mode is **Advanced**.

| Category | Subtitle |
| --- | --- |
| Account | Nuvio account and profiles |
| Appearance | Theme, accent color, and font |
| Layout | Home structure and poster styles |
| Content & Discovery | Add-ons, catalogs, and collections |
| Integrations | Manage available integrations |
| Plugins | Scraper repositories and plugins *(Advanced only)* |
| Playback | Auto-play and next-episode behavior |

## Account

| Control | Type | What it does | Works? |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Accounts | Value card | Opens sign-in / account status for the Nuvio account | Wired |
| Manage Profiles | Action | Add, rename, recolor, PIN-lock and remove profiles | Wired |

### Separate per profile

Seven switches. **On:** each profile keeps its own copy. **Off:** one shared copy
for the whole device. Turning one off falls back to the shared copy; turning it
back on finds each profile's own state where it was.

| Control | What it splits per profile | Works? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Add-ons | Installed add-ons and their order | Wired |
| Plugins | Plugin repositories and scrapers | Wired |
| Debrid logins | Real-Debrid / Premiumize / TorBox and the preferred service | Wired |
| Player & subtitles | Playback and caption settings | Wired |
| TMDB | TMDB key, language and enrichment choices | Wired |
| Theme & appearance | Accent, font and settings style | Wired |
| Stream badges | Badge pack and size | Wired |

## Appearance

| Control | Type | What it does | Works? |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Accent Color | Swatch row | Highlight color across the app. One swatch per palette in `CueThemes.all` | Wired |
| Black Background | Switch | Flat black stage (AMOLED) — drops both the grey depth wash and the accent bloom, and the Detail hero scrim fades to the same black | Wired |
| Font | Chips | Typeface across the app (`AppFont.allCases`) | Wired |
| Experience Mode | Chips | **Essential** / **Advanced**. Essential hides the Plugins section and the advanced Playback cards (auto-play source, player engine, on-screen display, audio) | Wired |
| Settings Style | Chips | **Classic** rounded / **Zen** pill / **Horizon** squared — reshapes settings cards and rows | Wired |

## Layout

### Home Layout

| Control | Type | What it does | Works? |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| *(layout picker)* | Cards | Chooses the Home layout | Wired |
| Landscape Posters | Switch | Portrait vs landscape cards for Modern view | Wired |
| Featured section | Switch | The rotating Featured banner between Continue Watching and the catalog rows | Wired |
| Hero layout | Dropdown | How the Home hero behaves. **Rolling Hero** — a banner that cycles the top ten on a timer; browsing never changes it. **Pinned Focus** — a fixed header above the rows showing whichever card holds focus; never cycles. **Hybrid** — cycles at the top of the page; move down into the rows and it becomes a Pinned Focus hero fixed to the top of the *screen*, following whichever card you're on. Press UP out of the first row to hand it back to the roll. **Hybrid is the default.** Replaces the old "Pin hero to the top" switch: on → Pinned Focus (an explicit choice, kept), off → Hybrid (never a choice, takes the default) | Wired |
| Hero source | Dropdown | Which catalog feeds the hero. **Automatic (first row)** is the default and the long-standing behaviour — whichever catalog sits first in your Home order. Pick any catalog an add-on declares to pin the hero to it instead. A chosen catalog that isn't on screen (switched off in the row list below, ranked past Home's row cap, or from an add-on since removed) falls back to the first row. The Featured bar always takes the first catalog that *isn't* the hero's, so the two never show the same row | Wired |
| Navigation Position | Dropdown | Where the primary navigation sits. **Left / Vertical** is the default and the shipped layout — a glass rail hugging the left edge that expands to labels on focus. **Top / Horizontal** turns the same component on its side: one bar across the top, always showing every tab's label and the profile chip. Same items, icons, focus bindings and glass either way. The bar floats OVER Home (the hero is never pushed down, exactly as the left pill floats beside it); the other tabs reserve clearance for it. Reach the navigation with Left (vertical) or Up (horizontal); step along it with Up/Down or Left/Right; leave it with Right or Down. Back behaves identically in both | Wired |
| Hide the sidebar | Switch | Gives rows the full screen width. LEFT from the page edge (or Menu) brings the sidebar back | Wired |
| Hero trailers | Switch | With the hero pinned, plays the highlighted title's trailer behind the name and details. **Pinned Focus only** — the rolling banner (Rolling / Hybrid) has never played trailers | Wired |
| Hero trailer sound | Switch | Plays the hero trailer with sound instead of muted | Wired |
| Full stream names | Switch | Source list shows each link's complete release name, wrapped rather than truncated | Wired |

### Posters

| Control | Type | What it does | Works? |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Poster labels | Switch | Title beneath poster cards | Wired |
| Poster banners | Switch | Shows the tags some add-ons print into their poster artwork ("In Cinema", "#2 Today", "New Movie"). Off uses the plain poster the add-on sends alongside (`posterFallback`) wherever it sends one, swapped in as catalogs and details are fetched: Home reloads on the switch, other screens pick it up the next time they load. Continue Watching and Library keep the artwork each title was saved with | Wired |
| Corner radius | Dropdown | Roundness of poster card corners | Wired |
| Hide unreleased content | Switch | Keeps unaired titles out of catalog rows | Wired |

### Rows & Details

| Control | Type | What it does | Works? |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Addon name in row titles | Switch | Appends the source addon's name to each catalog row header | Wired |
| Type suffix in row titles | Switch | Appends "- Movie" / "- Series" to row headers | Wired |
| Full release date | Switch | Full date on the details page instead of just the year | Wired |
| Trailer button | Switch | Shows the Trailer button on the details page | Wired |

### Layout → Details Page

Which optional sections appear below a title's artwork. All default ON, so a viewer who never opens these sees the page exactly as it always was. These are DISPLAY switches and are independent of the per-section TMDB enrichment switches under Integrations → TMDB, which decide whether the data is fetched at all — a section with no data stays hidden either way.

| Setting | Type | What it does | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Creator and Cast | Switch | The row of directors, writers and cast members | Wired |
| Collection | Switch | The "part of…" row for a title in a series of films, listing the others | Wired |
| More Like This | Switch | Recommended titles based on the one being viewed | Wired |
| Production | Switch | The studios and production companies behind the title | Wired |
| Comments | Switch | Viewer comments from Trakt | Wired |

The episode browser on a series is deliberately NOT toggleable — it is how an episode is chosen, so hiding it would leave a series unplayable.

| Blur unwatched episodes | Switch | Spoiler-blurs unwatched episode thumbnails (focus reveals) | Wired |
| Blur Continue Watching next up | Switch | Spoiler-blurs art for barely-started next-up episodes on the home row | Wired |

### P2P (TorrServer)

tvOS cannot run a torrent engine on-device, so P2P routes through a TorrServer
instance on the network.

| Control | Type | What it does | Works? |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Enable P2P | Switch | Plays torrent sources through TorrServer when no debrid provider is set | Wired — gates `TorrentSettings.isConfigured`, which `TorrServerService.resolve` requires |
| Server URL | Text | TorrServer base URL, e.g. `http://192.168.1.10:8090` | Wired |
| Test connection | Action | Pings the server | Wired |
| **Hide torrent stats** | Switch | *Claims to* hide peer/seed counts while streaming | **DEAD** — the value is persisted and decoded, but **no code reads it**. The switch does nothing. |

## Known interactions with open bugs

Three settings are entangled with bugs currently being worked:

**Prefer same source group** (Playback → Auto-play) — when Auto Pick advances an
episode it deliberately prefers the same release group / same addon as the
episode just watched, *ahead of the top-ranked link*. If Auto Pick appears to
"choose the second source" while the first looks fine, this setting is the most
likely explanation, and it is working as designed. Turning it off makes the
advance take the best-ranked playable link instead.

**Match content display mode** (Playback → Player) — this only governs *non-DV*
content; Dolby Vision requests its mode regardless. Both paths funnel through a
session display pin that, until recently, recorded only the refresh rate and not
the dynamic range — which meant only the first title of each foreground stint
could set the TV's HDR mode, and a DV title opened after anything else played
out as plain HDR.

**Hybrid disk cache** (Playback → Player) — on by default. It opens a parallel
download pool against the stream origin and ramps up until the server pushes
back with 429s. For a self-hosted aggregator that also proxies the media, this is
worth knowing about when diagnosing "Source Failed" errors: turning it off
removes the pool entirely, at the cost of instant seeking.

---

## Method and limits

- Control inventory extracted from the Settings view sources by parsing the
  balanced argument list of every row constructor (`SettingsToggleCard`,
  `SettingsGroupCard`, `PerfToggleRow`, `PlaybackToggleRow`, `CueDropdown`,
  `SettingsActionRow`, `SettingsValueCard` and the bespoke key/provider rows),
  then read back against the source for the panes the parser handled poorly.
- Wiring determined by tracing each stored property to a reader outside its own
  store and outside the Settings views — then re-checking every apparent orphan
  for consumption through a computed aggregate.
- **Not verified on an Apple TV.** "Wired" means connected in code. It does not
  mean each control was exercised on device.
- Behaviour of individual add-ons, debrid providers and TorrServer instances is
  outside what static analysis can confirm.
