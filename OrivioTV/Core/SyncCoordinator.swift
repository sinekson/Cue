/// Kicks a FULL sync of every destination whenever something sync-relevant
/// happens locally — a title finished, a rating changed, a profile deleted —
/// instead of leaving it for the next periodic tick.
///
/// The individual managers already push the single item that changed. That
/// covers the common case, but it is not the same thing: a per-item push sends
/// one row to one service, whereas the events here (a profile switch, a
/// deletion, a title finishing) usually mean several stores moved at once and
/// the whole picture needs reconciling everywhere. This is the "and now make
/// everything agree" pass.
///
/// Two pieces of pacing, because "immediately" and "on every single event" are
/// not the same requirement:
///
/// * A short **trailing debounce**. "Mark Season Watched" fires one event per
///   episode — twenty-odd in the same runloop turn. Without collapsing them
///   that single button press would start twenty full syncs.
/// * A **minimum interval** between runs, with the last request kept and run
///   when the floor lifts. Nothing is dropped; it is deferred, so a burst of
///   activity can't turn into a full sync every second or two.
