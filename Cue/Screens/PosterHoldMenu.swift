// direct ViewModifiers that read their own stores from the environment, so they
// drop onto any card without threading dependencies.
//
// NOTE on the Apple TV ("Modern") theme: the system `CardButtonStyle` (its
// parallax platter) swallows `.contextMenu`, so cards that need a working hold
// menu there use the flat card style instead (see `mediaCardButtonStyle`). The
// parallax stays on the browse cards; only the Continue Watching row opts out.
