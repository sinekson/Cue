/// On tvOS, AVKit will only drive PiP from an `AVPlayerLayer`. The
/// sample-buffer content source (`AVSampleBufferDisplayLayer` plus a playback
/// delegate) exists in the tvOS SDK, but the platform adapter behind
/// `AVPictureInPictureController` refuses it: its `isContentSourceSupported`
/// accepts player-layer, video-call and generic-view sources and masks out the
/// sample-buffer kind, so the controller's status never leaves "prohibited",
/// `isPictureInPicturePossible` never turns true, and `startPictureInPicture`
/// logs "failed; status = 0". Verified on tvOS 26.5 and 26.6 both by
/// disassembling AVKit and by probing a live session on an Apple TV 4K
/// (`-pipProbe`): the same session arms within seconds on the native engine
/// and never arms on FFmpeg. So of this app's engines:
///
/// * **KSAVPlayer** (native, mp4/HLS and the DV remux tier) — `AVPlayerLayer`.
///   The only one that can.
/// * **KSMEPlayer** (FFmpeg) — draws into an `AVSampleBufferDisplayLayer`.
///   Blocked by the platform, not by anything here.
/// * **DVSampleEngine** — its own `AVSampleBufferDisplayLayer`. Same.
/// * **VLC** — its own drawable, no CALayer AVKit could adopt anyway.
///
/// Availability is still decided per SESSION rather than assumed: the control
/// is hidden unless the engine that actually loaded produced a player layer
/// and AVKit reports PiP possible for it. On a title the native engine could
/// play but that is running elsewhere (mp4/HLS on FFmpeg or VLC), the options
/// menu offers the row anyway and one press switches engines and starts PiP
/// once armed — see `PlayerViewModel.enterPictureInPictureViaNativeEngine`.
/// On mkv and the other FFmpeg-only containers there is no row at all.
