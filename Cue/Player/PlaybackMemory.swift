// Two small persistent memories that make repeat playback feel deliberate:
//
//  ContainerSniffer   Learns what an extensionless URL actually contains, so
//                     the NEXT open routes to the right engine instead of
//                     re-guessing. First open still defaults to FFmpeg (it
//                     plays everything); the sniff runs alongside and records
//                     the truth for the session's decision log and the cache.
//
//  PlaybackMemory     Per-title choices the user made by hand — engine, audio
//                     language, subtitle language, speed — replayed the next
//                     time the same title plays, so a file that needed VLC
//                     last week doesn't re-fight the same battle.
