/// deletes the directory when the session ends. That deletion is best-effort
/// by construction — it runs as the player is being dismissed, and a remux
/// session is exactly the workload most likely to get the app jetsammed on a
/// 3 GB box, so the process is often gone before the delete completes. Every
/// time that happens the directory is orphaned with no owner left to remove
/// it: found on a real Apple TV 4K (1st gen) as **3.2 GB across 15 leaked
/// directories**, three of them ~1 GB each.
///
/// Nothing else ever cleaned them up. tvOS does purge `tmp/` under storage
/// pressure, but only once the box is nearly full — long after the app has
/// been swapping, stuttering and getting killed. So the sweep has to be ours,
/// and it has to run at LAUNCH: that is the one moment we know for certain
/// that no remuxer owns any of these directories.

/// same way and for the same reason — the app dies with requests in flight —
/// so they are swept on the same pass (179 MB / 12,231 files on that device).
///
/// The hybrid disk cache's file (`Caches/hybrid-cache/current.bin`) is the
/// third case, and the largest of them: `MediaCacheServer.endSession()` deletes
/// it on player teardown, but teardown only runs on a normal exit. A crash, a
/// jetsam kill, or the user force-quitting mid-film leaves TENS OF GIGABYTES
/// stranded, and nothing would ever remove it — the next `beginSession` only
/// clears the file if a cache session actually starts, so turning the feature

///   line only runs while the player is open, which is why the staircase that
///   ended in the panic was invisible.
/// - **vms** — live `PlayerViewModel` count. Leaked players are what fills the
///   memory; the leak probe already counts them but only shouted into NSLog.
/// - **state** — foreground / inactive / background, tracked from the lifecycle
