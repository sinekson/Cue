///    after all the seeks are done. `av_read_frame` doesn't free what the packet
///    already holds, so each read past the first leaked its buffer. The leak
///    scales with PACKET SIZE, i.e. with bitrate — a 4K (or high-bitrate 1080p)
///    stream leaks megabytes per read, tens of reads per seek, 36 seeks: enough
///    to get the app jetsam-killed mid-playback regardless of how small the file
///    is. Here every read is unref'd in a `defer`.
/// 2. **It could not be cancelled or timed out.** It opened the input with no
///    options and no interrupt callback, so `Task.isCancelled` couldn't stop a
///    blocked network read: the pass kept a second connection and a full decoder
///    alive after the player closed. Here an AVIO interrupt callback polls a
///    cancel flag, the same mechanism DVRemuxer uses, plus `rw_timeout`.
/// 3. **It used every core.** Default `thread_count` on a software decode of 4K
///    keyframes competes directly with the playback decode. Capped at 2 here.
