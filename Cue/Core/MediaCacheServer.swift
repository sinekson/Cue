/// The hybrid disk cache: a localhost HTTP proxy between the player engines
/// and a direct-file stream, Infuse-style.
///
/// The in-memory read-ahead buffer tops out at a few hundred MB on tvOS (see
/// `BufferProfile` — RAM is the ceiling, and jetsam is the penalty), so a deep
/// seek always lands beyond the buffer and stalls on the network. This server
/// downloads the WHOLE file to the app's caches directory at full line speed
/// while playback runs, and serves the engines' range requests from disk — so
/// once a region has downloaded, seeking into it is instant, and a fully
/// downloaded film seeks like a local file.
///
/// Design constraints that shaped it:
/// * One session at a time (one film), replaced on the next `beginSession`.
///   The cache file lives in Caches (purgeable by the OS, cleared eagerly on
///   session end) — nothing survives that shouldn't.
/// * Direct http(s) files only. HLS playlists never qualify (their URLs are
///   many small files, useless to cache this way) and are screened out by
///   extension before a session starts.
/// * Fail OPEN: anything unexpected — origin refuses ranges mid-flight, disk
///   fills, downloader dies — flips the session to redirect mode, and every
///   subsequent request is answered with a 307 to the origin. The engines
///   follow redirects, so the worst case is exactly today's direct playback.
/// * A deep forward seek REPOSITIONS the downloader to the seek point (the
///   viewer's position wins over sequential completeness); the gap left
///   behind is filled after the tail finishes.
/// * SLIDING WINDOW: a film bigger than the free disk still caches — the
///   download fills up to a budget (free space minus slack), then pauses;
///   as playback advances, blocks well behind the playhead are hole-punched
///   out of the sparse file (APFS `F_PUNCHHOLE`) and the download resumes.
///   The window keeps a rewind margin behind the viewer; a request for bytes
///   the window has already passed is answered with a redirect to the origin
///   (fail open, per request). Needs a range-capable origin.
///
/// Everything runs on one serial queue — listener, connections, and the
/// URLSession delegate all target it, so there is no shared-state locking to
/// get wrong.

            // 1. The token is a fresh UUID per session, so restarting here
            //    minted a NEW proxy url every time — and the player's
            //    "don't do this again" guards (`dvFirstTried`, `dvFailedURLs`,
            //    `probedURLs`) are all keyed on the url string. None of them

            //    the teardown killed the connection feeding the engine that had
            //    just been started, which failed it over into another load —
            //    a self-sustaining reload loop in which nothing ever played.
            // 2. Even without that, throwing away a partly-downloaded film on
            //    an engine swap or a failover is pure waste.
            // The session is kept, but its URL is only worth handing out if
